<h1>Application Programming Interfaces to GAMS</h1>
<p>There are three versions of the object-oriented GAMS API: <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b> and <b>.NET</b>. These APIs work with Java SE 5 and up, Python 2.7, and .NET framework 4 (Visual Studio 2010) and up. The object-oriented GAMS API allows the seamless integration of GAMS into an application by providing appropriate classes for the interaction with GAMS. The <i>GAMSDatabase</i> class for in-memory representation of data can be used for convenient exchange of input data and model results. Models written in GAMS can be run with the <i>GAMSJob</i> class and by using the <i>GAMSModelInstance</i> class a sequence of closely related model instances can be solved in the most efficient way.</p>
<p>In addition to the object-oriented GAMS API, there exist low-level (or expert-level) APIs to some libraries of the GAMS system (<i>GAMSx</i>, <i>GDX</i>, and <i>Option</i>). These APIs are used internally in GAMS for a long time and tested extensively. While they offer high performance and flexibility, they also require advanced knowledge and it is recommended that the object-oriented GAMS API is used if possible. The low-level APIs are offered for <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>Delphi</b>, <b>Fortran</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>Visual Basic</b>.</p>

<h2>Further Documentation</h2>
<p>For each of the three versions of the object-oriented GAMS API there exist an additional document: <a href="GAMS_java.pdf">GAMS Java API</a>, <a href="GAMS_python.pdf">GAMS Python API</a>, and <a href="GAMS.net4.chm">GAMS .NET API</a>. For Java there also exists a <a href="../../apifiles/Java/api/javadoc/index.html">Javadoc version</a>.</p>
<p>For the low-level APIs there exist some summary pages containing an overview of the exported function in pseudo code: <a href="expert-level/gamsxqdrep.html">GAMSx API</a>, <a href="expert-level/gdxqdrep.html">GDX API</a>, and <a href="expert-level/optqdrep.html">Option API</a>. Additional information is available as <a href="expert-level/gdxioapi.chm">CHM</a> and <a href="expert-level/gdxioapi.pdf">PDF</a> for <b>GDX</b>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>There are several examples for the different programming languages in <code>[Path/To/GAMS]/apifiles/</code>. In that directory there is also a <a href="../../apifiles/readme.txt">ReadMe.txt</a>, which describes how to build and execute these examples.</p>
