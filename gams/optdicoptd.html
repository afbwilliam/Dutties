<h2>Detailed Descriptions of DICOPTD Options</h2>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDcontinue">
continue</a>
<i> (integer)</i> How to proceed in case of NLP errors</h4><p>

This option can be used to let DICOPT continue in case of NLP solver failures. The preferred approach
is to fix the model, such that NLP subproblems solve without problems. However, in some cases we can
ignore (partial) failures of an NLP solver in solving the NLP subproblems as DICOPT may recover later on.
During model debugging, you may therefore add the option continue 0, in order for DICOPT to function
in a more finicky way.

<br><i>(default = 2)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>Stop on solver failure.
Stop on solver failure. DICOPT will terminate when an NLP subproblem can not be solved to optimality.
Some NLP solvers terminate with a status other than optimal if not all of the termination criteria
are met. For instance, the change in the objective function is negligable (indicating convergence) but
the reduced gradients are not within the required tolerance. Such a solution may or may not be close
the (local) optimum. Using <tt>continue 0</tt> will cause DICOPT not to accept such a solution.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Accept non-optimal feasible solutions.
NLP subproblem failures resulting in a non-optimal but feasible solutions are accepted. Sometimes
an NLP solver can not make further progress towards meeting all optimality conditions, although the
current solution is feasible. Such a solution can be accepted by this option.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>2</td><td>Ignore infeasible solutions.
NLP subproblem failures resulting in a non-optimal but feasible solution are accepted (as in option
<tt>continue 1</tt>). NLP subproblem failures resulting in an infeasible solution are ignored. The corresponding
configuration of discrete variables is forbidden to be used again. An integer cut to accomplish this,
is added to subsequent MIP master problems. Note that the relaxed NLP solution should be feasible.
This setting is the default.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDdomlim">
domlim</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of allowed number of domain errors</h4><p>

Sets a limit of the number of function and derivative evaluation errors for a particular cycle. A number of
-1 means that the global GAMS option <tt>domlim</tt> is used. The last number <i>i<sub>n</sub></i> sets a domain error limit for
all cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, ....
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>domlim 0 100 0</tt><br>
The NLP solver in the second cycle is allowed to make up to 100 evaluation errors, while all other
cycles must be solved without evaluation errors.
</blockquote>
The default is to use the global GAMS <tt>domlim</tt> option.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDepsmip">
epsmip</a>
<i> (real)</i> Tolerance on test on monotonic improvement of MIP master problem</h4><p>

This option can be used to relax the test on MIP objective functions. The objective function values of the
MIP master problems should form a monotonic worsening curve. This is not the case if the MIP master
problems are not solved to optimality. Thus, if the options <tt>OPTCR</tt> or <tt>OPTCA</tt> are set to a nonzero value, this
test is bypassed. If the test fails, DICOPT will fail with a message:
<blockquote><pre>
The MIP solution became better after adding integer cuts.
Something is wrong. Please check if your model is properly
scaled. Also check your big M formulations -- the value
of M should be relatively small.
This error can also occur if you used a MIP solver option
file with a nonzero OPTCR or OPTCA setting. In that case
you may want to increase the EPSMIP setting using a
DICOPT option file.
</pre></blockquote>
The value of
<blockquote>
<i>(PreviousObj - CurrentObj) / (1 + |PreviousObj|)</i>
</blockquote>
is compared against <tt>epsmip</tt>. In case the test fails, but you want DICOPT to continue anyway, you may want
to increase the value of <tt>epsmip</tt>. The current values used in the test (previous and current MIP objective,
<tt>epsmip</tt>) are printed along with the message above, so you will have information about how much you
should increase <tt>epsmip</tt> to pass the test. Normally, you should not have to change this value. The default
is <i>x = 1.0e-6</i>.

<br><i>(default = 1.0e-6)</i>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDepsx">
epsx</a>
<i> (real)</i> Tolerance for integer values when loading relaxed solution</h4><p>

This tolerance is used to distinguish integer variables that are set to an integer value by the user, or integer
variables that are fractional. See the option <tt>relaxed</tt>. Default: <i>x = 1.0e-3</i>.

<br><i>(default = 1.0e-3)</i>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDinfeasder">
infeasder</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Use derivatives of infeasible nonlinear subproblems</h4><p>

This option is to determine whether linearizations of infeasible NLP subproblems are added or not to the
MIP master problem.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>No linearizations of infeasible NLP subproblems.
This is the default option in which no linearizations are added in the infeasible NLP subproblems. In
this case a simple integer cut is added to remove from consideration the 0-1 vector that gave rise to
the infeasible NLP. Since this may slow the convergence, it is recommended to reformulate the MINLP
with "elastic" constraints (i.e. adding slacks to infeasible constraints and adding a penalty for them in
the objective) so as to ensure that the NLP subproblems are mathematically feasible.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Add linearization for infeasible NLP subproblems.
This will add linearizations derived from the infeasible NLP subproblem to the master problem. This
option is recommended to speed up convergence when the MINLP is known to be convex (i.e. its
continuous relaxation is convex). If used for a nonconvex MINLP possibility of cutting-off the global
optimum is increased.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDInfMode">
InfMode</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Mode of infeasibility handling</h4><p>


<br><i>(default = 0)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>Infeasibility handler user 1-Norm</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Infeasibility handler user Inf-Norm</td></tr>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDIntCut">
IntCut</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Integer Cuts</h4><p>


<br><i>(default = 1)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>No Integer Cuts</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Disaggregate integer variables and add binary cuts</td></tr>

<i> (integer)</i> Mode of linearization</h4><p>


<br><i>(default = 0)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>Linearize active constraints only</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Linearize all constraints</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDmaxcycles">
maxcycles</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Maximum number of cycles</h4><p>

The maximum number of cycles or major iterations performed by DICOPT.

<br><i>(default = 20)</i>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDmipiterlim">
mipiterlim</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of iteration limits</h4><p>

Sets an iteration limit on individual MIP master problems. The last number <i>i<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all subsequent
cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, .... A number of -1 indicates that there is no (individual) limit on the corresponding MIP
master problem. A global iteration limit is maintained through the GAMS option <tt>iterlim</tt>.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipiterlim 10000 -1</tt><br>
The first MIP master problem can not use more than 10000 iterations, while subsequent MIP master
problems are not individually restricted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipiterlim 10000</tt><br>
Sets an iteration limit of 10000 on all MIP master problems.
</blockquote>
The default for
this option is not to restrict iteration counts on individual solves of MIP master problems.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDmipoptfile">
mipoptfile</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of option files for MIP solver</h4><p>

Specifies the option file to be used for the MIP master problems. Several option files can be specified,
separated by a blank. If a digit 1 is entered, the default option file for the MIP solver in question is being
used. The digit 0 indicates: no option file is to be used. The last option file is also used for subsequent MIP
master problems.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipoptfile mip.opt mip2.opt 0</tt><br>
This option will cause the first MIP master problem solver to read the option file <tt>mip.opt</tt>, the second
one to read the option file <tt>mip2.opt</tt> and subsequent MIP master problem solvers will not use any
option file.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipoptfile 1</tt><br>
This will cause the MIP solver for all MIP subproblems to read a default option file (e.g. <tt>cplex.opt</tt>,
<tt>xpress.opt</tt>, <tt>osl2.opt</tt> etc.).
</blockquote>
Option files are located in the current directory (or the project directory when using the IDE). The default
is not to use an option file.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDmipreslim">
mipreslim</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of resource limits</h4><p>

Sets a resource (time) limit on individual MIP master problems. The last number <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all
subsequent cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, .... A number -1.0 means that the corresponding MIP master problem is not
individually time restricted. A global time limit is maintained through the GAMS option reslim.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipreslim -1 10000 -1</tt><br>
The MIP master problem in cycle 2 can not use more than 100 seconds, while subsequent MIP master
problems are not individually restricted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipreslim 1000</tt><br>
Sets a time limit on all MIP master problems of 1000 seconds.
</blockquote>
The default for
this option is not to restrict individually the time a solver can spent on the MIP master problem.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDmipsolver">
mipsolver</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of MIP solvers</h4><p>

This option specifies with MIP solver to use for the MIP master problems.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>mipsolver cplex osl2</tt>
This instructs DICOPT to use Cplex for the first MIP and OSL2 for the second and subsequent MIP
problems. The last entry may be used for more than one problem.
</blockquote>
The names to be used for the solvers are the same as one uses in the GAMS statement <tt>OPTION MIP=....;</tt>.
The default is to use the default MIP solver.
Note that changing from one MIP solver to another can lead to different results, and may cause DICOPT
to follow a different path.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlpiterlim">
nlpiterlim</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of iteration limits</h4><p>

Sets an iteration limit on individual NLP subproblems. The last number <i>i<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all subsequent
cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, .... A number of -1 indicates that there is no (individual) limit on the corresponding NLP
subproblem. A global iteration limit is maintained through the GAMS option iterlim.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpiterlim 1000 -1</tt><br>
The first (relaxed) NLP subproblem can not use more than 1000 iterations, while subsequent NLP
subproblems are not individually restricted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpiterlim 1000</tt><br>
Sets an iteration limit of 1000 on all NLP subproblems.
</blockquote>
When this option is used it is advised to have the option continue set to its default of 2. The default is
not to restrict the amount of iterations an NLP solver can spend on an NLP subproblem, other than the
global iteration limit.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlpoptfile">
nlpoptfile</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of option files for NLP solver</h4><p>

Specifies the option file to be used for the NLP subproblems. Several option files can be specified, separated
by a blank. If a digit 1 is entered, the default option file for the NLP solver in question is being used.
The digit 0 indicates: no option file is to be used. The last option file is also used for subsequent NLP
subproblems.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpoptfile nlp.opt nlp2.opt 0</tt><br>
This option will cause the first NLP subproblem solver to read the option file <tt>nlp.opt</tt>, the second one
to read the option file <tt>nlp2.opt</tt> and subsequent NLP subproblem solvers will not use any option file.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpoptfile 1</tt><br>
This will cause the NLP solver for all NLP subproblems to read a default option file (e.g. <tt>conopt.opt</tt>,
<tt>minos.opt</tt>, <tt>snopt.opt</tt> etc.).
</blockquote>
Option files are located in the current directory (or the project directory when using the IDE). The default
is not to use an option file.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlpreslim">
nlpreslim</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of resource limits</h4><p>

Sets a resource (time) limit on individual NLP subproblems. The last number <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all subsequent
cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, .... A number -1.0 means that the corresponding NLP subproblem is not individually time
restricted. A global time limit is maintained through the GAMS option reslim.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpreslim 100 -1</tt><br>
The first (relaxed) NLP subproblem can not use more than 100 seconds, while subsequent NLP subproblems
are not individually restricted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpreslim 1000</tt><br>
Sets a time limit of 1000 seconds on all NLP subproblems.
</blockquote>
When this option is used it is advised to have the option continue set to its default of 2. The default for
this option is not to restrict individually the time an NLP solver can spend on an NLP subproblem (other
than the global resource limit).


<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlpsolver">
nlpsolver</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of NLP solvers</h4><p>

This option specifies which NLP solver to use for the NLP subproblems.
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>nlpsolver conopt minos snopt</tt><br>
tells DICOPT to use CONOPT for the relaxed NLP, MINOS for the second NLP subproblem and
SNOPT for the third and subsequent ones. The last entry is used for more than one subproblem: for
all subsequent ones DICOPT will use the last specified solver.
</blockquote>
The names to be used for the solvers are the same as one uses in the GAMS statement <tt>OPTION NLP=....;</tt>.
The default is to use the default NLP solver. Note that changing from one NLP solver to another can lead
to different results, and may cause DICOPT to follow a different path.


<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlptracefile">
nlptracefile</a>
<i> (string)</i> Base name of trace files</h4><p>

Name of the files written if the option <tt>nlptracelevel</tt> is set. Only the stem is needed: if the name is specified
as <tt>nlptracefile nlptrace</tt>, then files of the form <tt>nlptrace.001</tt>, <tt>nlptrace.002</tt>, etc. are written. These
files contain the settings of the integer variables so that NLP subproblems can be investigated independently
of DICOPT.

<br><i>(default = nlptrace)</i>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDnlptracelevel">
nlptracelevel</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Trace level</h4><p>

This sets the level for NLP tracing, which writes a file for each NLP sub-problem, so that NLP sub-problems
can be investigated outside the DICOPT environment. See also the option <tt>nlptracefile</tt>.
By including a trace file to your original problem, and changing it into an MINLP problem, the subproblem
will be solved directly by an NLP solver. This option only works if the names in the model (names of
variables and equations) are exported by GAMS. This can be accomplished by using the <tt>m.dictfile</tt> model
suffix, as in <tt>m.dictfile=1;</tt>. In general it is more convenient to use the CONVERT solver to generate isolated
NLP models.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>No trace info is written.
No trace files are written. This is the default.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>GAMS file with fixed integer variables.
A GAMS file for each NLP subproblem is written which fixes the discrete variables.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>2</td><td>Include levels of continuous variables.
As <tt>nlptracelevel 1</tt>, but in addition level values of the continuous variables are written.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>3</td><td>Include all levels and marginals.
As <tt>nlptracelevel 2</tt>, but in addition marginal values for the equations and variables are written.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDoptca">
optca</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of OPTCA values</h4><p>

The absolute optimality criterion for the MIP master problems. The GAMS option <tt>optca</tt> is ignored, as by
default DICOPT wants to solve MIP master problems to optimality. To allow to solve large problem, it is
possible to stop the MIP solver earlier, by specifying a value for <tt>optca</tt> or <tt>optcr</tt> in a DICOPT option file.
With setting a value for <tt>optca</tt>, the MIP solver is instructed to stop as soon as the gap between the best
possible integer solution and the best found integer solution is less than <i>x</i>, i.e. stop as soon as
<blockquote><i>
  |BestFound - BestPossible|  <= x
</i></blockquote>
It is possible to specify a different <tt>optca</tt> value for each cycle. The last number <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all subsequent
cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, ....
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>optca 10</tt><br>
Stop the search in all MIP problems as soon as the absolute gap is less than 10.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>optca 0 10 0</tt><br>
Sets a nonzero optca value of 10 for cycle 2, while all other MIP master problems are solved to
optimality.
</blockquote>


<h4><a name="DICOPTDoptcr">
optcr</a>
<i> (string)</i> List of OPTCR values</h4><p>

The relative optimality criterion for the MIP master problems. The GAMS option <tt>optca</tt> is ignored, as by
default DICOPT wants to solve MIP master problems to optimality. To allow to solve large problem, it is
possible to stop the MIP solver earlier, by specifying a value for <tt>optca</tt> or <tt>optcr</tt> in a DICOPT option file.
With setting a value for <tt>optcr</tt>, the MIP solver is instructed to stop as soon as the relative gap between the
best possible integer solution and the best found integer solution is less than <i>x</i>, i.e. stop as soon as
<blockquote><i>
|BestFound - BestPossible|/|BestPossible| <= x
</i></blockquote>
Note that the relative gap can not be evaluated if the best possible integer solution is zero. In those cases
the absolute optimality criterion <tt>optca</tt> can be used. It is possible to specify a different <tt>optcr</tt> value for each
cycle. The last number <i>x<sub>n</sub></i> is valid for all subsequent cycles <i>n</i>, <i>n+1</i>, ....
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>optcr 0.1</tt><br>
Stop the search in all the MIP problems as soon as the relative gap is smaller than 10%.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Example: <tt>optcr 0 0.01 0</tt><br>
Sets a nonzero <tt>optcr</tt> value of 1% for cycle 2, while all other MIP master problems are solved to
optimality.
</blockquote>


<h4><a name="DICOPTDrelaxed">
relaxed</a>
<i> (integer)</i> How to start DICOPT</h4><p>

In some cases it may be possible to use a known configuration of the discrete variables. Some users have
very difficult problems, where the relaxed problem can not be solved, but where NLP sub-problems with
the integer variables fixed are much easier. In such a case, if a reasonable integer configuration is known in
advance, we can bypass the relaxed NLP and tell DICOPT to directly start with this integer configuration.
The integer variables need to be specified by the user before the solve statement by assigning values to the
levels, as in <tt>Y.L(I) = INITVAL(I);</tt>.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>Start with all integers fixed to the starting value.
The first NLP sub-problem will be executed with all integer variables fixed to the values specified by
the user. If you don&#146;t assign a value to an integer variable, it will retain it&#146;s current value, which is
zero by default.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Start with relaxed NLP.
The first NLP problem is the relaxed NLP problem: all integer variables are relaxed between their
bounds. This is the default.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>2</td><td>Start with mixture of fixed and relaxed integers.
The first NLP subproblem will be executed with some variables fixed and some relaxed. The program
distinguishes the fixed from the relaxed variables by comparing the initial values against the bounds
and the tolerance allowed <tt>EPSX</tt>. <tt>EPSX</tt> has a default value of <i>1.e-3</i>. This can be changed in through the
option file.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDsolvelink">
solvelink</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Solvelink for NLP and MIP subsolver</h4><p>

Choose solvelink for NLP and MIP subsolver calls

</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDstop">
stop</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Stopping criterion</h4><p>

This option defines the stopping criterion to be used. The search is always stopped when the (minor)
iteration limit (the iterlim option), the resource limit (the reslim option), or the major iteration limit
(see <tt>maxcycles</tt>) is hit or when the MIP master problem becomes infeasible.
Note: In general a higher number stops earlier, although in some cases stopping rule 2 may terminate the
search earlier than rule 1.

<br><i>(default = 2)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>Stop on maxcycles.
Do not stop unless an iteration limit, resource limit, or major iteration limit is hit or an infeasible MIP
master problem becomes infeasible. This option can be used to verify that DICOPT does not stop too
early when using one of the other stopping rules. In general it should not be used on production runs,
as in general DICOPT will find often the optimal solution using one of the more optimistic stopping
rules.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>Stop on crossover.
Stop as soon as the bound defined by the objective of the last MIP master problem is worse than the
best NLP solution found (a &#147;crossover&#148; occurred). For convex problems this gives a global solution,
provided the weights are large enough. This stopping criterion should only be used if it is known or it
is very likely that the nonlinear functions are convex. In the case of non-convex problems the bounds
of the MIP master problem are not rigorous. Therefore, the global optimum can be cut-off with the
setting stop 1.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>2</td><td>Stop on worsening.
Stop as soon as the NLP subproblems stop to improve. This &#147;worsening&#148; criterion is a heuristic. For
non-convex problems in which valid bounds can not be obtained the heuristic works often very well.
Even on convex problems, in many cases it terminates the search very early while providing an optimal
or a very good integer solution. The criterion is not checked before major iteration three.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>3</td><td>Stop on crossover or worsening.
Stop as soon as a crossover occurs or when the NLP subproblems start to worsen. (This is a combination
of 1 and 2).</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="DICOPTDweight">
