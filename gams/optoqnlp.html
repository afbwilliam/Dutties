<h2>Detailed Descriptions of OQNLP Options</h2>

<h4><a name="OQNLPartificial_bound">
artificial_bound</a>
<i> (real)</i> default upper/lower bound</h4><p>

This value (its negative) is given to the driver as the upper (lower) bound
for any variable with no upper or lower bound. However, the original
bounds are given to the local solver, so it can produce solutions not limited
by this artificial bound. All drivers must have finite upper and lower
bounds for each variable. If <tt>artificial_bound</tt> (or any of the user- supplied
bounds) is much larger than any component of the optimal solution,
the driver will be less efficient because it is searching over a region that
is much larger than needed. Hence the user is advised to try to provide
realistic values for all upper and lower bounds. It is even more dangerous
to make <tt>artificial_bound</tt> smaller than some component of a globally
optimal solution, since the driver can never generate a trial point near
that solution. It is possible, however, for the local solver to reach a global
solution in this case, since the artificial bounds are not imposed on it

<br><i>(default = 10000)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPbasin_decrease_factor">
basin_decrease_factor</a>
<i> (real)</i> reduction of MAXDIST</h4><p>

<p>
This value must be between 0 and 1. If <a
href="#dynamic_distance_filter"><tt>dynamic_distance_filter</tt></a> is set to 1,
the <i>MAXDIST</i> value associated with any local solution is reduced by
(1-<tt>basin_decrease_factor</tt>) if <a
href="#distance_waitcycle"><tt>distance_waitcycle</tt></a> consecutive trial points
have distance from that solution less than <i>MAXDIST</i>.

<br><i>Range: [0,1]</i>

<br><i>(default = 0.2)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPbasin_overlap_fix">
basin_overlap_fix</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for MAXDIST logic</h4><p>

A value of 1 turns on logic which checks the <i>MAXDIST</i> values of all pairs
of local solutions, and reduces any pair of <i>MAXDIST</i> values if their sum
is greater than the distance between the 2 solutions. This ensures that the
spherical models of their basins of attracting do not overlap. A value of 0
turns off this logic. Turning it off can reduce the number of NLP solver calls,
but can also cause the algorithm to miss the global solution.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPdistance_factor">
distance_factor</a>
<i> (real)</i> distance activation factor</h4><p>

If the distance between a trial point and any local solution found previously is
less than <tt>distance_factor</tt>*<i>MAXDIST</i>, the NLP solver is not started
from that trial point. <i>MAXDIST</i> is the largest distance ever traveled to
get to that local solution. Increasing distance_factor leads to fewer solver
calls and risks finding a worse solution. Decreasing it leads to more solver
calls and possibly a better solution.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPdistance_waitcycle">
distance_waitcycle</a>
<i> (integer)</i> iterations before distance filter threshold is increased</h4><p>

This value must be a positive integer. If the distance filter is used, and there
are <tt>distance_waitcycle</tt> consecutive iterations where the distance filter logic
causes the NLP solver not to be started, the distance filter threshold is increased
by the factor <a
href="#threshold_increase_factor"><tt>threshold_increase_factor</tt></a>. Increasing
<tt>distance_waitcycle</tt> usually leads to fewer solver calls, but risks finding
a worse solution. Decreasing it leads to more solver calls, but may find a
better solution.

<br><i>(default = 20)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPdynamic_distance_filter">
dynamic_distance_filter</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for MAXDIST reduction logic</h4><p>

A value of 1 turns on logic which reduces the value of <i>MAXDIST</i> (described
under the <a href="#use_distance_filter"><tt>use_distance_filter</tt></a> keyword)
for a local solution if <a
href="#distance_waitcycle"><tt>distance_waitcycle</tt></a> consecutive trial
points have a their distances from that solution less than
<i>MAXDIST</i>. <i>MAXDIST</i> is multiplied by
(1-<tt>basin_reduction_factor</tt>). A value of 0 turns off this logic. Turning
it off can decrease the number of NLP solver calls, but can also lead to a worse
final solution.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPdynamic_merit_filter">
dynamic_merit_filter</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for merit threshold increase logic</h4><p>

A value of 1 turns on logic which dynamically varies the parameter which
increases the merit filter threshold, <a
href="#threshold_increase_factor"><tt>threshold_increase_factor</tt></a>. If <a
href="#merit_waitcycle"><tt>merit_waitcycle</tt></a> consecutive trial points have
been rejected by the merit filter, this value is replaced by
<tt>max(threshold_increase_factor, val)</tt>, where <tt>val</tt> is the value of
<tt>threshold_increase_factor</tt> which causes the merit filter to just accept
the best of the previous <tt>merit_waitcycle</tt> trial points. A value of 0
turns off this logic. Turning it off can reduce NLP solver calls, but may lead
to a worse final solution.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPenable_screen_output">
enable_screen_output</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for log output</h4><p>

A value of 0 turns off the writing of the iteration log and termination
messages to the gams log file that appears on the screen, while 1 enables
it.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPenable_statistics_log">
enable_statistics_log</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for statistics file stats.log</h4><p>

Using a value of 1 creates a text file called <tt>stats.log</tt> in the project
directory containing one line of problem (name, variables, constraints) and
performance information (best objective value, total solver time, iterations,
iterations to best solution, etc) for each problem solved.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPfeasibility_tolerance">
feasibility_tolerance</a>
<i> (real)</i> feasibility check for point returned by NLP solver</h4><p>

This tolerance is used to check each point returned by an NLP solver for
feasibility. If the largest absolute infeasibility at the point is larger than
this tolerance, the point is classified infeasible. This test is made because
points returned by NLP solvers may occasionally be infeasible despite
feasible status codes. Some NLP solvers use internal scaling before testing
for feasibility. The unscaled problem may be infeasible, while the scaled
one is feasible. If this occurs, increasing this tolerance (to 1.e-2 or larger)
often eliminates the problem.

<br><i>(default = 0.0001)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPiteration_limit">
iteration_limit</a>
<i> (integer)</i> total number of OQNLP iterations</h4><p>

Increasing this limit can allow OQNLP to find a better solution. Try it
if your run using 1000 iterations does not take too long. Surprisingly, the
best solution using, say 2000 iterations, may be found in the first 1000
iterations, and that solution may be better than the one found with an
iteration limit of 1000. This is because OptQuest changes its search strategy
depending on the iteration limit. Because of this, it is also possible
that increasing the iteration limit will yield a worse solution, but this is
rare. Decreasing this iteration limit usually leads to a worse solution, but
also reduces run time. OQNLP iterations can not be set using GAMS
iterlim. The GAMS iterlim is used as the iteration limit for the NLP
subsolves in a OQNLP run

<br><i>(default = 1000)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPiteration_print_frequency">
iteration_print_frequency</a>
<i> (integer)</i> frequency of iteration print<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synonym:
gams_itn_print_frequency</h4><p>

If the OQNLP iteration log is written to the GAMS log file, one line of output is
written every <i>k</i>th iteration, where <i>k</i> is the value given here.

<br><i>(default = 20)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPlocals_file">
locals_file</a>
<i> (string)</i> filename for local file</h4><p>

Specify a complete path and name for a file to which the objective value and
values of all variables for all local solutions found will be written.  For
example, <tt>C:\mydirectory\locals.out</tt>. There are 2 possible formats for
this file, specified by the <a
href="#locals_file_format"><tt>locals_file_format</tt></a> option below. If there
is no <tt>locals_file</tt> record in the options file, the locals file will not
be created.


<h4><a name="OQNLPlocals_file_format">
locals_file_format</a>
<i> (string)</i> file format for local file</h4><p>

There are 2 possible values for this option. The <tt>report</tt> entry creates
the locals file in a format designed to be examined easily by eye, but
processed less easily by a computer program or spreadsheet. The <tt>data1</tt>
entry creates a file with many records, each on a single line, each line
having the following format: [index of local optimum] [objval] [var index] [var value]

<br><i>(default = report)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>report</td><td>Report file format</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>data1</td><td>Data1 file format</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="OQNLPmaxtime">
maxtime</a>
<i> (integer)</i> maximum runtime in seconds<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synonym:
reslim</h4><p>

When the execution time exceeds this value, the system will stop, returning
the best solution found.

<br><i>(default = GAMS ResLim)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPmax_locals">
max_locals</a>
<i> (integer)</i> maximum number of local optima found</h4><p>

When the number of distinct local solutions found exceeds the value specified
here, the system will stop, returning the best solution found.

<br><i>(default = 1000)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPmax_solver_calls">
max_solver_calls</a>
<i> (integer)</i> maximum number of nlp solver calls</h4><p>

When the number of calls to the NLP solver exceeds the value specified
here, the system will stop, returning the best solution found.

<br><i>(default = 1000)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPmax_solver_calls_noimprovement">
max_solver_calls_noimprovement</a>
<i> (integer)</i> maximum number non-improving solver calls</h4><p>

The positive integer specified here will cause the system to stop whenever
the number of consecutive solver calls with a fractional improvement in
the best objective value found less than 1.e-4 exceeds that value. In other
words, if the value specified is 50, and there are more than 50 consecutive
solver calls where the relative change in the best objective was less than
1.e-4 in all iterations, the system will stop.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPmerit_waitcycle">
merit_waitcycle</a>
<i> (integer)</i> iterations before merit filter threshold is increased</h4><p>

This value must be a positive integer. If the merit filter is used, and there
are <tt>merit_waitcycle</tt> consecutive iterations where the merit filter logic
causes the NLP solver not to be started, the merit filter threshold is increased
by the factor <a
href="#threshold_increase_factor"><tt>threshold_increase_factor</tt></a>. Increasing
<tt>merit_waitcycle</tt> usually leads to fewer solver calls, but risks finding
a worse solution. Decreasing it leads to more solver calls, but may find a
better solution.

<br><i>(default = 20)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPnlpsolver">
nlpsolver</a>
<i> (string)</i> NLP solver to be used</h4><p>

This option is available only within GAMS. It specifies the NLP solver to be
called. Any GAMS NLP solver for which the user has a license can be
used. Further, one can specify an option file for the GAMS NLP solver by
appending a <tt>.n</tt> with <i>n=1..999</i> to the solver name. For example,
<tt>NLPSOLVER conopt.1</tt> will instruct the NLP solver CONOPT to use option
file <tt>conopt.opt</tt>, <tt>NLPSOLVER conopt.2</tt> will make CONOPT read
option file <tt>conopt.op2</tt> and so on.

<br><i>(default = lsgrg)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPoptquest_only">
optquest_only</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch for using local solvers</h4><p>

This option applies only to the OptQuest driver. If you think the NLP
solver is taking too long and/or not working well, choosing 1 will stop
it from being called. This may occur if the problem is of type <tt>DNLP</tt>,
where one or more problem functions are discontinuous or have discontinuous
derivatives. If the problem has only discrete (integer) variables,
choose 1, as there is nothing for the NLP solver to do (since it optimizes
over the continuous variables when the integers are fixed, and there none).

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPoqnlp_debug">
oqnlp_debug</a>
<i> (integer)</i> enable debug info<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synonym:
msnlp_debug</h4><p>

Values of 1 or 2 cause more information to be written to the iteration log.
The default value of 0 suppresses all this output.

<br><i>Range: [0,2]</i>

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPpoint_generation">
point_generation</a>
<i> (string)</i> starting point generator</h4><p>

Selection of point generation algorithm.

<br><i>(default = optquest)</i>
<table>

distribution defined within its bounds</td></tr>

<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>smartrandom1</td><td>smart random point generation.

</table>

<h4><a name="OQNLPsampling_distribution">
sampling_distribution</a>
<i> (integer)</i> distribution for smartrandom1</h4><p>

This keyword is relevant only when <a
href="#point_generation"><tt>point_generation</tt></a> is set to
<tt>smartrandom1</tt>. Then a value of 0 causes normal distributions to be used
to generate trial points, while a value of 1 causes triangular distributions to
be used.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>0</td><td>normal</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>1</td><td>triangular</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="OQNLPsearch_type">
search_type</a>
<i> (string)</i> search strategy</h4><p>

This option applies only to the OptQuest driver, and controls the search
strategy used by OptQuest. There are three choices that are relevant for use
within OQNLP.

<br><i>(default = boundary)</i>
<table>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>aggressive</td><td>aggressive search.
This choice controls the population update in step 7 of the OptQuest algorithm
(see Appendix A of the User Guide). It triggers a very aggressive update,
which keeps the best of the points generated from the current population as the
new population. The risk in this is that all points in the new population may
cluster in a small portion of the search volume, and regions far from this
volume will not be explored in the next cycle.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>boundary</td><td>boundary search.
This option affects the trial points generated by OptQuest, directing them
toward the boundary of the region defined by the linear constraints and variable
bounds. The value of <a href="#search_parameter"><tt>search_parameter</tt></a>
discussed below controls the fraction of points that are directed toward the
boundary.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>crossover</td><td>crossover search.
This option affects how OptQuest trial points are generated from population
points. It retains the linear combination operator discussed in Appendix A of
the User Guide, but adds a <i>crossover</i> operator, similar to those used in
evolutionary or genetic algorithms, to create 2 additional trial points.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="OQNLPsolvelink">
solvelink</a>
<i> (integer)</i> Solvelink for GAMS NLP solver</h4><p>


<br><i>(default = 5)</i>

<tr valign="top"><td width=20 align=right>2</td><td>Call GAMS NLP solver via module</td></tr>

</table>

<h4><a name="OQNLPsolver_log_to_gams_log">
solver_log_to_gams_log</a>
<i> (integer)</i> switch to copy the NLP solver log to the normal log file</h4><p>

Setting the parameter to 1 instructs OQNLP to copy the log from the
NLP subsolver to the OQNLP log. It can be very helpful to inspect the
NLP subsolver log especially if the solver termination code is <tt>???</tt>.

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPstage1_iterations">
stage1_iterations</a>
<i> (integer)</i> number of iterations in stage 1</h4><p>

Specifies the total number of iterations in stage 1 of the algorithm, where
no NLP solver calls are made. Increasing this sometimes leads to a better
starting point for the first local solver call in stage 2, at the cost of delaying
that call. Decreasing it can lead to more solver calls, but the first call
occurs sooner.

<br><i>(default = 200)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPthreshold_increase_factor">
threshold_increase_factor</a>
<i> (real)</i> factor to increase merit filter threshold</h4><p>

This value must be nonnegative. If there are <a
href="#merit_waitcycle"><tt>merit_waitcycle</tt></a> consecutive OQNLP
iterations where the merit filter logic causes the NLP solver not to be called,
the merit threshold is increased by multiplying it by
(1+<tt>threshold_increase_factor</tt>). The same applies to the <a
href="#distance_waitcycle"><tt>distance_waitcycle</tt></a>.

<br><i>(default = 0.2)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPuse_distance_filter">
use_distance_filter</a>
<i> (integer)</i> distance filter</h4><p>

Use 0 to turn off the distance filter, the logic which starts the NLP solver at
a trial point only if the (Euclidean) distance from that point to any local
solution found thus far is greater than the distance threshold. Turning
off the distance filter leads to more solver calls and more run time, and
increases the chances of finding a global solution. Turn off both distance
and merit filters to find (almost) all local solutions.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPuse_linear_constraints">
use_linear_constraints</a>
<i> (integer)</i> satisfy linear constraints</h4><p>

This option applies only to the OptQuest driver, and to problems that have
linear constraints other than simple bounds on the variables. Using 1 (all
OptQuest trial points satisfy the linear constraints) often leads to fewer
iterations and solver calls, but OptQuest has to solve an LP to project
each trial point onto the linear constraints. For large problems (more than
100 variables), this can greatly increase run time, so the default value is
off (0).

<br><i>(default = 0)</i>

<h4><a name="OQNLPuse_merit_filter">
use_merit_filter</a>
<i> (integer)</i> merit filter</h4><p>

Use 0 to turn off the merit filter, the logic which starts the NLP solver
at a trial point only if the penalty function value at that point is below
the merit threshold. This will lead to more solver calls, but increases the
chances of finding a global solution. Turn off both filters if you want to
find (almost) all local solutions. This will cause the solver to be called at
each stage 2 iteration.

<br><i>(default = 1)</i>
