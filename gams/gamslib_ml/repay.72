$Title Repayment factors for loans  (REPAY,SEQ=72)

$Ontext

   This sample problem computes the monthly payments for a 1000 dollar
   loan to be repaid in equal installments. The monthly payment is derived
   as follows.


GAMS Development Corporation, Formulation and Language Example.

   p(0) = 1000
   p(1) = p(0)*(1+rate)/periods - pay

   p(t) = p(t-1)*(1+rate)/periods - pay = 0

   where "p" is the principal outstanding at the beginning of a period and
   "rate" is the annual interest rate. "periods" are the payment periods
   per year. "pay" is the payment per period. The loan has to be repaid
   completely after "t" payments within "years" years. The number of
   payments "t" is "periods"*"years".

   with  sum(n, q**(ord(n)-1)) = (1-q**card(n))/(1-q)    find

       pay = 1000*rate/periods/(1-(1+rates/periods)**(-periods*years)).
