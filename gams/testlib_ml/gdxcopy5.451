$title Test GDX environment variables with trailing blanks (GDXCOPY5,SEQ=451)

$ontext
Trailing or leading blanks in the GDX environment variables caused
the automatically translation via gdxcopy to fail. There was no indication
why the gdxcopy failed, other than a usage screen.

In GAMS we have to work hard to get a trailing blank, in shell script
this error is easily made.
