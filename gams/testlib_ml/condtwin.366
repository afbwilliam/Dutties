$Title CONOPTD with two solves in a row (CONDTWIN,SEQ=366)
$Ontext

This model checks if it is possible to run conopt with solvelink 5 two times
in a row, then with cplexd, at the end two times with conopt again.

      san-diego        2.5           1.8          1.4  ;

  Scalar f  freight in dollars per case per thousand miles  /90/ ;

  Parameter c(i,j)  transport cost in thousands of dollars per case ;

            c(i,j) = f * d(i,j) / 1000 ;

  Variables
       x(i,j)  shipment quantities in cases
       z       total transportation costs in thousands of dollars ;

  Positive Variable x ;

  Equations
       cost        define objective function
       supply(i)   observe supply limit at plant i
       demand(j)   satisfy demand at market j ;

  cost ..        z  =e=  sum((i,j), c(i,j)*x(i,j)) ;

  supply(i) ..   sum(j, x(i,j))  =l=  a(i) ;
