$TITLE 'test for data errors caused by C compiler bug' (COMPILE2,SEQ=289)

$ontext
There is a bug in the Intel 9.1.XXX compilers (e.g. 9.1.043) that
causes some floating point computations to be incorrect - not by a
little, but just plain wrong.  This causes problems with many models.
This example is taken from a model sent by Michael Ferris that was our
first reported instance of this problem.
