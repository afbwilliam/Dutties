$TITLE Test the set.id set#id #id data macros (SET8,SEQ=437)

$ontext

In 23.0 and older, we got bad data structures when using these
'macros' in table statements.  This resulted in not being able to
write gdx files and bad workfiles that could not be read.  Another
problem was that these 'macros' could not be in the first row or first
column.
