$title $ifthen false without sameline (IFTHEN5,SEQ=477)

$ontext
  The $if statement syntax allows for a missing command

  $if condition  true_line

  or
  $if condition
  true_line

This is not allowed with $ifthen or $elseif. We cannot skip the next line
if we have no true_line and condition=FALSE.
