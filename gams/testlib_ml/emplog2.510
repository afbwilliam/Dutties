$Title Test simple logical conditions  (EMPLOG2,SEQ=510)

$ontext
Verify that 'b2 =e= 1' is accepted as logical condition. There is no need
to do it this way, but this corresponds to 'not b1 =e 1' which is/was allowed.
Use both ways of defining a logic equation, via the keyword logic and the sign =B=.
