$title Many free variables and restart with EMP (EMPLP03,SEQ=381)

$ontext

This model tests lp03 from the Test Library with solver EMP. In the first test
EMP generates a standard scalar model which is solved by the default lp solver.
A second test with EMP rewriting the model as MCP is not done since lp03 is a
simplex-only test.
